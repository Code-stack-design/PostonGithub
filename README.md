My Beginner’s League Journey

Beginner’s League is a fun one-week online competition, and I had the opportunity to attend all the sessions. Each day brought something new to learn, and the classes were both interesting and inspiring.
On the first day, Aamina handled the introduction, explaining how the schedule would go, what challenges we would face, and how the winners would be selected. Her session gave us a clear idea of what to expect throughout the week.













Beginner's League is a fun one week online competition. I have attended all the classes. The classes are really interesting to listen to. The first day Aamina took the introduction part which was really good. We came to know about what all things and how the schedule will be going. She talked about the challenges and how you will be selected as the winner. Then second day was about product design by Enric S Neelamkavil. He talked about UI/UX design and product designing. The third day , the class was taken by Aswin Asok on Frontend. Eventhough I wasn't able to understand everything. I got clarifications on certain things he said which I thought was true. Then the class was taken by Afnan K Salal about backend and yesterday it was Machine Learning by Pranav Krishna.He basically tried to explain what is machine learning. He did not get into the code part instead made us understand the basics of machine learning. How it is done and data plays the important role in it. Only if u have the correct sufficient data will you be able to do projects properly.
