Beginnerâ€™s League is a fun, one-week online competition made for students who are new to tech.
You donâ€™t need to be a coding expert. You donâ€™t even need to know everything. All you need is the curiosity to learn and the courage to try.
Over 7 days, youâ€™ll:
ðŸ§© Solve small, simple challenges (like writing a basic program or trying out a design)
ðŸŽ“ Join workshops every day to learn something new
âš¡ Build cool mini-projects (called Power-Up Challenges) that show what youâ€™ve learned.
ðŸ¥š Hunt for surprise bonus tasks (called Easter Eggs) during workshops.

You get points for every challenge you complete.
At the end of the week, the students with the most points win exciting prizes!
But itâ€™s not just about winning â€” itâ€™s about:
Learning new skills
Building your confidence
Meeting awesome people from 9 different colleges
And discovering what youâ€™re capable of# Beginner's League Submission
